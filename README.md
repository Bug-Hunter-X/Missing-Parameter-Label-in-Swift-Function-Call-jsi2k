# Missing Parameter Label in Swift Function Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include parameter labels when calling a function that expects labeled arguments. The Swift compiler requires these labels for clarity and disambiguation.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect function call that causes the compilation error. The `bugSolution.swift` file illustrates the corrected version.

This issue can lead to compilation failures and make code harder to read and maintain. Always ensure you provide the correct labels to avoid such errors.
